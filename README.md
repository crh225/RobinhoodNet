This is a .NET client of the publically available REST API for the popular Robinhood
zero comission trading app. It targets the Portable subset of the .NET Framework for
maximum portability. The RobinhoodNet projects comes with a dynamic, as well as strongly
typed version of the client.

The RobinhoodNet client is still in its early stages of development, but it already supports:
* quoting of symbols
* instrument lookup
* placing new orders
* cancelling working orders
* downloading of order book
* getting list of accounts
* getting account information

More features to come.

Please take a look at the Rh* folders for examples of quoting and order operations.
